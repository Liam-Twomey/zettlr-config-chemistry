Zettlr is set up for use in a broad range of scientific fields, and I've found it necessary to customize a bunch of the default settings, including the export settings and a large autocorrect and snippet library.

My hope is that this helps other chemists and biochemists to get started with Zettlr settings. To use, follow the Zettlr [instructions](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/reference/migrating/) for migrating computers. Only replace these files on a fresh install, before you've modified them! Otherwise, you'll have to figure out how to merge files properly.
